# ProductivityBooster

A chrome extension designed to boost your productivity. All you have to do is add a todo list and a list of websites that hinder your productivity and the extension will do its best to keep you on track with your goals for the day.

This project was created in 3 days with my friend Juan Martos to help us stay on track with our academic goals.

To trigger the website blocking mechanism, all you need to do is activate the 'Grind Mode' button in the pop-up tab!
